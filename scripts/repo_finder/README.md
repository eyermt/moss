## Scoring System Breakdown

### Association Score

#### What It Represents

The **Association Score** measures the direct relevance of a repository to the university based on the number of search queries it matches. It reflects how many of the predefined search criteria a repository satisfies.

#### How It's Calculated

- **Formula**: `Association Score = Number of Matching Queries`

- **Explanation**: We define a set of search queries that include the university's name, acronym, email domain, and any additional keywords. Each repository is checked against these queries.

- **Calculation Steps**:
  1. **Define Search Queries**: For example:
     - `"University of Example" in:name,description,readme`
     - `"UOE" in:name,description,readme`
     - `"uoe.edu" in:email`
     - Additional user-defined queries
  2. **Search Repositories**: Use GitHub's API to find repositories matching these queries.
  3. **Count Matches**: For each repository, count how many queries it matches.
  4. **Assign Score**: The total number of matching queries becomes the Association Score.

#### Rationale

A higher Association Score indicates a stronger association with the university, as the repository matches more of the university-specific criteria.

---

### Confidence Score

#### What It Represents

The **Confidence Score** estimates the likelihood that a repository is affiliated with the university. It considers various indicators such as mentions of the university in the repository's content, ownership by university organizations, and contributions from university-affiliated individuals.

#### How It's Calculated

- **Formula**: `Confidence Score = (Total Points / 500) * 100`, capped at 100%

- **Explanation**: Points are awarded based on the presence of university identifiers in different parts of the repository and contributor profiles. The total points are normalized to a percentage to obtain the Confidence Score.

- **Calculation Steps**:
  1. **Define University Identifiers**: These include:
     - University name (e.g., "University of Example")
     - University acronym (e.g., "UOE")
     - University email domain (e.g., "uoe.edu")
     - University website URL (e.g., "uoe.edu")
  2. **Assign Point Values**:
     - Repository name and description: 20 points per identifier
     - Repository topics/tags: 20 points per identifier
     - README content: 20 points per identifier
     - Owner's profile (if user): 20 points per identifier
     - Owner's organization details (if organization): 30 points per identifier
     - Contributors' emails: 15 points per match
     - Contributors' profiles: 10 points per match
     - Affiliated repositories of contributors: 5 points per repository
  3. **Search for Identifiers**:
     - **In Repository**:
       - Name and description
       - Topics/tags
       - README content
     - **In Owner Details**:
       - If organization, check organization's name, description, blog, email, and location
       - If user, check user's bio
     - **In Contributors**:
       - Email domains
       - Bio content
       - Affiliation indicators in their other repositories
  4. **Calculate Total Points**: Sum all points from the above steps.
  5. **Normalize Score**: Convert total points to a percentage:
     - `Confidence Score = (Total Points / 500) * 100`
     - Cap the score at 100%

#### Example Calculation

Suppose a repository has the following:

- Repository name mentions "University of Example": +20 points
- README mentions "UOE": +20 points
- Owned by an organization with "uoe.edu" in its email: +30 points
- Two contributors with emails ending in "@uoe.edu": +15 points each
- Total Points: 20 + 20 + 30 + 15 + 15 = 100 points
- Confidence Score: (100 / 500) * 100 = 20%

#### Rationale

The Confidence Score aggregates multiple affiliation signals to provide a probabilistic measure of the repository's connection to the university. Normalizing the score ensures comparability across repositories.

---

### Activity Score

#### What It Represents

The **Activity Score** evaluates the repository's recent development and community engagement. It considers various metrics such as commits, issues, pull requests, and contributor activity within a specified time window.

#### How It's Calculated

- **Formula**:

  ```
  Activity Score = Σ (Normalized Metric Score × Metric Weight)
  ```

  The final score is normalized between 1 and 100.

- **Metrics and Weights**:

  | Metric                             | Default (OSSci) Weight (%) |
  |------------------------------------|--------------------|
  | Recent Commits Count               | 20                 |
  | Active Contributors Count          | 15                 |
  | Recent Issues Opened Count         | 10                 |
  | Recent Issues Closed Count         | 10                 |
  | Average Time to Close Issues       | 5                  |
  | Recent PRs Opened Count            | 10                 |
  | Recent PRs Merged Count            | 10                 |
  | Average Time to Merge PRs          | 5                  |
  | Growth in Stars                    | 5                  |
  | Growth in Forks                    | 5                  |
  | Recent Releases Count              | 5                  |
  | Total Downloads in Time Window     | 5                  |
  | Discussion Activity Count          | 0                  |
  | **Total**                          | **100%**           |

- **Normalization of Metrics**:
  - For metrics where **higher is better**:
    - `Normalized Score = min((Actual Value / Maximum Value), 1) × 100`
  - For metrics where **lower is better** (e.g., average times):
    - `Normalized Score = max(((Maximum Value - Actual Value) / Maximum Value), 0) × 100`

- **Maximum Values for Normalization** (Adjustable):

  | Metric                       | Maximum Value |
  |------------------------------|---------------|
  | Recent Commits Count         | 500           |
  | Active Contributors Count    | 50            |
  | Recent Issues Opened Count   | 100           |
  | Recent Issues Closed Count   | 100           |
  | Average Time to Close Issues | 24 hours      |
  | Recent PRs Opened Count      | 100           |
  | Recent PRs Merged Count      | 100           |
  | Average Time to Merge PRs    | 24 hours      |
  | Growth in Stars              | 1,000         |
  | Growth in Forks              | 500           |
  | Recent Releases Count        | 20            |
  | Total Downloads              | 10,000        |
  | Discussion Activity Count    | 500           |

- **Calculation Steps**:
  1. **Collect Metrics**: Gather activity data within the specified time window (default is 6 months).
  2. **Normalize Each Metric**:
     - Use the formulas above to convert actual values into normalized scores between 0 and 100.
  3. **Apply Weights**:
     - Multiply each normalized score by its corresponding weight.
  4. **Sum Weighted Scores**:
     - Add up all weighted scores to get the preliminary Activity Score.
  5. **Normalize Final Score**:
     - Ensure the Activity Score is between 1 and 100.

#### Example Calculation

Suppose we have the following metrics:

- Recent Commits: 250 (out of 500)
- Active Contributors: 25 (out of 50)
- Recent Issues Opened: 50 (out of 100)
- Recent Issues Closed: 50 (out of 100)
- Average Time to Close Issues: 12 hours (max is 24 hours)
- Recent PRs Opened: 50 (out of 100)
- Recent PRs Merged: 50 (out of 100)
- Average Time to Merge PRs: 12 hours (max is 24 hours)
- Stars Growth: 500 (out of 1,000)
- Forks Growth: 250 (out of 500)
- Recent Releases: 10 (out of 20)
- Total Downloads: 5,000 (out of 10,000)
- Discussion Activity: 250 (out of 500)

**Normalization**:

- Recent Commits Normalized Score: (250 / 500) × 100 = 50
- Active Contributors Normalized Score: (25 / 50) × 100 = 50
- Average Time to Close Issues Normalized Score: ((24 - 12) / 24) × 100 = 50

**Applying Weights**:

- Recent Commits Weighted Score: 50 × 0.20 = 10
- Active Contributors Weighted Score: 50 × 0.15 = 7.5
- Average Time to Close Issues Weighted Score: 50 × 0.05 = 2.5

**Summing Weighted Scores**:

- Total Activity Score = 10 + 7.5 + 2.5 + ... (continue for all metrics)

**Final Score**:

- Sum all weighted scores to get the Activity Score.
- Ensure the score is between 1 and 100.

#### Rationale

The Activity Score provides a composite measure of the repository's vitality and community engagement. By normalizing metrics and applying weights, we ensure that the score reflects both the quantity and quality of activity.

#### Customization

- **Time Window**: Users can adjust the time window for recent activity (e.g., last 3 months, 12 months).
- **Weights**: Users can customize the weights assigned to each metric based on their priorities.
