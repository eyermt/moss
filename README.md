# Map of Open Source Science (MOSS)
MOSS is a project of [OSSci](https://www.opensource.science/), an initiative of [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/).


## Overview

This Map of Open Source Science is a proof of concept right now and as such, nothing is accurate.

This project aims to map open source software and scientific (e.g., peer-reviewed) research via one comprehensive project. This repository houses the backend (e.g., database, API endpoints, etc.) as well as various front-end frameworks (in /frontends) which allow for cool visualizations.

## Running

To start the backend, which is deployed on a production basis at [backend.some-domain-we-need-to-buy.com](backend.some-domain-we-need-to-buy.com) and at a beta/development basis at [beta.some-domain-we-need-to-buy.com](beta.some-domain-we-need-to-buy.com) simply run

> (Instructions for dependency installations go here; Contact Mark Eyer for details.)
> python3 main.py

To start the frontend(s), of which the primary web-based one can be found in production at [some-domain-we-need-to-buy.com](some-domain-we-need-to-buy.com), follow the instructions in the /src/frontends subdirectories. In general, it contains an early iteration of a front-end built using Kumu. We want to build something similar but better.

## Contributing

We are still in the process of writing up all our formal procedures on how to contribute code to this repository. A rough draft is located [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) While we accept outside pull requests, the best way to get your contribution accepted is to contact Jon Starr (jring-o) and he can connect you with our weekly technical meetings and give you a brief orientation.

We follow NumFOCUS's [code of conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct).
